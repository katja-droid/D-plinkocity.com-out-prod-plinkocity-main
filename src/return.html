            At PlinkoCity, we value your satisfaction highly. If you are unhappy with a purchase, we have a straightforward return process to assist you:
        </p>

        <p class="modal__p">1. Eligibility for Returns:</p>
        <p>To be eligible for a return, items must be in their original condition: unworn, with all original tags attached, and in the original packaging. Customized or personalized items can only be returned if they are defective or damaged upon arrival.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            2. Return Period:
        </p>
        <p>You must initiate a return within 14 days of receiving your item. Please contact our customer service team promptly to begin the return process.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            3. How to Return:
        </p>
        <p>Email our support team to obtain a return authorization. Securely repackage the product in its original packaging, including all accessories, and label it with the return authorization number. Return the item using a traceable shipping method. The customer bears return shipping costs unless the return is due to our error.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            4. How to Return an Item:
        </p>
        <p>Once we receive and inspect your returned item, we will process your refund or exchange. Refunds are issued to the original payment method within 5-7 business days. Exchanges are subject to stock availability; if the item is unavailable, we may offer a refund or a replacement. We do not refund original shipping fees unless the return is due to our error.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            5. Damaged or Incorrect Items:
        </p>
        <p>If your item arrives damaged or is not what you ordered, contact our customer service immediately with photos and a detailed description of the problem. We will cover the return shipping costs for such items and arrange for a refund or replacement as necessary.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            6. Non-Returnable Items:
        </p>
        <p>Certain items, like undergarments, are not returnable for hygiene reasons. Please refer to the specific product descriptions for details or contact our customer support if you need more information.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            7. Return Policy Exceptions:
        </p>
        <p>Items purchased from external vendors or third-party sellers are not eligible for return through our platform. Please review the return policies of these sellers before making your purchase.</p>

        <p>For further assistance or questions about our return policies, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact our customer support team at info@PlinkoCity.com. We are dedicated to ensuring your full satisfaction and providing excellent customer service.</p>
