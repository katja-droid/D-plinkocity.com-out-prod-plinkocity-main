            At Megajos.com, your satisfaction is paramount. If you are dissatisfied with your purchase, we offer clear guidelines for returns. Here are the steps and rules to assist you:
        </p>

        <p class="modal__p">1. Return Eligibility:</p>
        <p>Items must be in their original condition for a return: unworn, with original tags attached, and in their initial packaging. Items that are customized or personalized are returnable only if they arrive defective or damaged.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            2. Time Frame for Returns:
        </p>
        <p>Returns must be initiated within 14 days of receipt. Please contact our customer service promptly to start the return process.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            3. How to Return:
        </p>
        <p>Email our support team to obtain a return authorization. Securely repackage the product in its original packaging, including all accessories, and label it with the return authorization number. Return the item using a traceable shipping method. The customer bears return shipping costs unless the return is due to our error.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            4. Processing Refunds and Exchanges:
        </p>
        <p>Upon receiving and inspecting your return, we will process your refund or exchange. Refunds are credited back to the original payment method within 5-7 business days. Exchanges depend on inventory availability; if unavailable, a refund or a replacement may be offered. Original shipping fees are non-refundable unless it is our mistake.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            5. Handling Damaged or Incorrect Items:
        </p>
        <p>If you receive an item that is damaged or incorrect, please contact our customer service immediately with photographs and a detailed account of the issue. We will handle return shipping costs for such items and provide a refund or replacement as needed.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            6. Items Not Eligible for Return:
        </p>
        <p>Some items, such as undergarments, cannot be returned due to hygiene concerns. Check the specific product descriptions for more details or reach out to our customer support for information.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            7. Exceptions to Return Policy:
        </p>
        <p>Items bought from external vendors or third-party sellers are not returnable through our platform. Check the return policies of these sellers before making a purchase.</p>

        <p>For additional help or questions about our return guidelines, please feel free to reach out to our customer support team at info@Megajos.com. We are here to ensure your complete satisfaction and to provide outstanding customer service.</p>
